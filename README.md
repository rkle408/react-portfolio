# react-portfolio

As an up-and-coming web developer, I need to showcase my skills. What better way than to upgrade my HTML, CSS, vanilla JS portfolio to a React portfolio?! This interface will make it more pleasing for the user, and hopefully, that'll mean more job opportunities for me!

Through the process of building my own portfolio, I finally understood the seamlessness that is a React application. Coding was also more seamless, as I no longer had to worry about balancing the header, navbar, and footer with new components.
