            <p>You read that right... yes, I'm a dentist!</p>
            <p>I recently embarked on journey through the rigorous courseload that is the UC San Diego Extension Full Stack Flex Bootcamp in hopes of starting my career as a web developer.</p>
            <p>Through the journey through HTML + CSS + vanilla JavaScript, MySQL, and now through Express, MongoDB, ReactJS, I learned that still I have much to learn... and I now have a soild foundation to build upon. </p>
            <p>It is my hope that one day, I can combine my knowledge of the dental/healthcare field with my contiuously growing knowledge of web development, to help not only other dentists, but improve the lives of patients.</p>
